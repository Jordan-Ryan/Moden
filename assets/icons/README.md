# Icon Set

Monochrome SVG icons designed for Moden. All icons use a 48×48 viewBox with black strokes on a transparent background so they can be tinted if needed.

- `assets/icons/settings.svg` – slider-style controls
- `assets/icons/today.svg` – calendar badge for the "Today" view
- `assets/icons/sleep.svg` – crescent moon motif
- `assets/icons/heart-rate.svg` – heart with ECG pulse
- `assets/icons/food.svg` – stylised apple
- `assets/icons/hydration.svg` – water droplet with highlight
- `assets/icons/activity.svg` – activity ring with progress arrow
- `assets/icons/mindfulness.svg` – lotus-inspired outline

Usage tips:

1. Import SVGs via your bundler or convert to PNGs at required sizes for platforms that do not support inline SVG.
2. Because the assets are pure vector strokes, you can safely recolor them in code by applying tint or fill styles.
